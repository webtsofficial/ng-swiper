# Hubble Captures Vivid Auroras in Jupiter’s Atmosphere

**NASA ID:** `hubble-captures-vivid-auroras-in-jupiters-atmosphere_28000029525_o`

Astronomers are using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study auroras — stunning light
shows in a planet’s atmosphere — on the poles of the largest planet in the solar system, 
Jupiter. This observation program is supported by measurements made by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, 
currently on its way to Jupiter.

Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is best known for its colorful storms, the 
most famous being the Great Red Spot. Now astronomers have focused on another beautiful feature 
of the planet, using Hubble's ultraviolet capabilities.

The extraordinary vivid glows shown in the new observations are known as auroras. They are 
created when high-energy particles enter a planet’s atmosphere near its magnetic poles and 
collide with atoms of gas. As well as producing beautiful images, this program aims to 
determine how various components of Jupiter’s auroras respond to different conditions in the 
solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun.

This observation program is perfectly timed as NASA’s Juno spacecraft is currently in the 
solar wind near Jupiter and will enter the orbit of the planet in early July 2016. While Hubble 
is observing and measuring the auroras on Jupiter, Juno is measuring the properties of the solar 
wind itself; a perfect collaboration between a telescope and a space probe.

“These auroras are very dramatic and among the most active I have ever seen”, said Jonathan 
Nichols from the University of Leicester, U.K., and principal investigator of the study. 
“It almost seems as if Jupiter is throwing a firework party for the imminent arrival of Juno.”
